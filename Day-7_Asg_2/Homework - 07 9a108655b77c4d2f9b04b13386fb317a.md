`grep` `sed` `awk`

`Grep`

****`Grep`**is a useful command to search for matching patterns in a file.** `grep`
 **is short for "global regular expression print".**

**Syntax of the `grep` Command**

`grep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]`

[grep searches for PATTERNS in each FILE. `Grep` finds each line that matched the provided PATTERN. It is a good practice to close the PATTERN in quotes when `grep` is used in a shell command.]

The following options that can be used with `grep`:

- `i`, `-ignore-case`: Ignores case distinctions in patterns and input data.
- `v`, `-invert-match`: Selects the non-matching lines of the provided input pattern.
- `n`, `-line-number`: Prefix each line of the matching output with the line number in the input file.
- `w`: Find the exact matching word from the input file or string.
- `c`: Count the number of occurrences of the provided pattern.

Sed

`sed` is a stream editor, and it can be used to edit text files, with its most common use being to replace occurrences of words in a files. This is extremely helpful in situations where a configuration file has a lot of instances of the same word that needs replacing throughout the file.

`sed -i 's/old-text/new-text/g' input.txt`
**sed -i 's/old-text/new-text/g' input.txt**

[to find all occurrences of ‘old-text‘ and replace with ‘new-text‘ in a file named input.txt]

The s is the substitute command of sed for find and replace. The -i tells to update the file. The **/** is the default delimiter, but it can be any character other than a backslash (**\**)[[1](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-use-sed-to-find-and-replace-text-in-files-in-linux-unix-shell/#ref1)] or newline (**\n**)[[1](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-use-sed-to-find-and-replace-text-in-files-in-linux-unix-shell/#ref1)] can be used instead of a slash (**/**) to delimit the regex and the replacement. For example, use **\** character as delimiter instead of the default **/** to find all occurrences of ‘FOO‘ and replace with ‘BAR‘ on GNU/Linux sed (the command will not work on BSD/macOS sed):

`awk`

`awk` is a scripting language used for manipulating data and generating reports. The `awk` command programming language requires no compiling and allows the user to use variables, numeric functions, string functions, and logical operators. 

**1. AWK Operations:**

(a) Scans a file line by line

(b) Splits each input line into fields

(c) Compares input line/fields to pattern

(d) Performs action(s) on matched lines

**2. Useful For:**

(a) Transform data files

(b) Produce formatted reports

**3. Programming Constructs:**

(a) Format output lines

(b) Arithmetic and string operations

(c) Conditionals and loops

**Syntax:**
`awk options 'selection _criteria {action }' input-file > output-file`

**Options:**  

```
-f program-file : Reads the AWK program source from the file
                  program-file, instead of from the
                  first command line argument.
-F fs            : Use fs for the input field separator
```
